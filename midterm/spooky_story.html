<h2>The Black Snake</h2>
<br>
<p>Jasper was obsessed with Little Big Snake, but one night, he encountered something terrifying</p>
<p>massive black snake with no name tag that stalked his every move. No matter how fast he slithered,</p>
<p>it was always there, closer and closer.</p>
<br>
<p>Suddenly, the chat flashed an impossible message:</p>
<h3>“You’re part of the game now.”</h3>
<br>
<p>Panicking, Jasper tried to quit, but the game froze. His screen flickered, revealing his own terrified</p>
<p>face trapped in the black snake’s scales. As the snake lunged, he felt a crushing force wrap around</p>
<p>his chest, squeezing tighter and tighter.</p>
<br>
<p>The game went dark with one final message:</p>
<h3>“Welcome forever.”</h3>
<br>
<p>Now, other players report a strange black snake, silent and nameless, lurking in their games. Jasper?</p>
<p>Gone.</p>
